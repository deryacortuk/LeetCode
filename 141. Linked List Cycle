# Coding Patterns: Fast & Slow Pointers

"  Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false."

1. Solution

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast, slow = fast.next.next, slow.next
            if fast == slow:
                return True
        return False
        
2. Solution

class Solution:   
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        temp = head
        while temp:
            if temp.val == None: 
                return True
            else:
                temp.val = None
                temp = temp.next
        return False
